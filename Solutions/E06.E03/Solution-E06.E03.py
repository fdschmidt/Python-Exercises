# In[9]:

# Initialize the number
number = 15


# In[10]:

# Case 1: Modulus of the division by two is zero
#         and the number is therefore even
if(number%2 == 0):
    print(str(number) + " is an even number.")
    
# Default: Modulus of the division by two is not zero
#          and the number is therefore odd
else:
    print(str(number) + " is an odd number.")
